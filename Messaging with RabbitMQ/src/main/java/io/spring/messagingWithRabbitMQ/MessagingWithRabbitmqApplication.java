/*
    Spring AMQPâ€™s RabbitTemplate provides everything you need to send and receive messages with RabbitMQ.
    However, you need to:

    1) Configure a message listener container.
    2) Declare the queue, the exchange, and the binding between them.
    3) Configure a component to send some messages to test the listener.

    You will use RabbitTemplate to send messages, and you will register a Receiver with
    the message listener container to receive messages.
    The connection factory drives both, letting them connect to the RabbitMQ server.

    Spring Boot automatically creates a connection factory and a RabbitTemplate,
    reducing the amount of code you have to write.

        JMS queues and AMQP queues have different semantics. For example,
        JMS sends queued messages to only one consumer. While AMQP queues do the same thing,
        AMQP producers do not send messages directly to queues. Instead,
        a message is sent to an exchange, which can go to a single queue or fan out to multiple queues,
        emulating the concept of JMS topics.

        There are two types of Queue - durable and non-durable.
        Durable queue survives a server restart.
